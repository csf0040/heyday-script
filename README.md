# Hey Day Auburn University Script

### What is Hey Day?

Hey Day is a tradition that has happened every year at Auburn University since 1947, when it started as a form of acknowledgment of the students and veterans of WWII. Since then, Hey Day has brought a sense of belonging to the Auburn community through students, staff, faculty, and others by giving a friendly **HEY!** and getting to know one another.
